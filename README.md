# chat-app

This application was built with the purpose of learning nodejs and socket.io
The application allows users to communicate in real time.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo run<br>
    `npm install`<br>
to install all the package dependencies.

You can then run the application locally (on windows) using:<br>
    `set PORT=**** && node src/index.js`<br>

Once the application is running you can go to <br>
    `localhost:PORT`<br>
in your browser and where PORT is the port you provided earlier.<br>

Once there you can open multiple tabs.<br>

Users should only be able to talk to eachother if they are within the same chat and have different usernames.
